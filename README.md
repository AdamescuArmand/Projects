# Projects

This repository contains the source code and documentation for projects I developed as part of my University Courses or simply due to Personal Interest.

## Repository Overview

One should mainly expect to find Python projects in this repository, as this is currently my main focus. However, you may also encounter projects developed in Java, C++, or various web technologies.
